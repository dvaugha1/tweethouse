  ## These follow, unfollow, follows methods will return user objects.
  ## The commented out alternatives below return relationship objects.
  ## Either version works fine to follow, unfollow, or check if one user follows another.

  ## For the "list a user's followers" view, you don't need these methods,
  ## you can just iterate over @user.followers and print the username for
  ## each follower with a link to their shouts page or similar.

  #   self.following.where("relationships.followed_id" => user.id).destroy!
